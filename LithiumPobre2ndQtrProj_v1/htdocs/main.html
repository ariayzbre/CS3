				<ul>
					<li>Today was the first day on campus. I got really tired of introducing myself in class over and over again, but at least
					I memorized most of my classmate's names. There are some who I've been classmates before.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>It was devastating that we temporarily have to go back to remote learning. I still communicate properly with my 
				close friends and a few batchmates via Discord. It was fun talking to them late at night especially while doing your requirements.
				I never felt an ounce of being alone, and I'm looking forward to seeing them again next week.
			</ul>
			<h3>Week 3</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Face to face classes are back! It was nice seeing everyone again, being able to hang out at the Bilog. This week, we went to the laboratory 
				and did a fun experiment. We didn't use biotic material yet, but we did observe the position of the letter "e" in the microscope. And here, we have
				a cute selfie with our teacher in Biology. She's very fun (and pretty of course).</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>But my week wasn't over yet. After hanging out at the lab, my friends Clive, Kin, Khash, and Emman went to the movies
					at KCC to watch a horror movie. It was frightening that I even recorded Khash and  I's screams for laughs (after that, we went to
					a batchmate's house where other batchmates were there). On the third to fourth picture, it was on a Saturday night on October 8, 2022.
					It was one of the most magical and refreshing nights of my life. I was with my friends Clive, Sasi, and Kin, and I met my old schoolmate
					along the way. We jammed to the music, rode the viking ride two times (no matter how scared Clive was), ate delicious food, and had a 
					nice jog in the oval of SMRAA. I went home at 10:00 PM that night, and thank God my mother didn't get mad at me. </li>
			<h3>Week 4</h3>
				<img src="LithiumPobre2ndQtrProj_v1/images/img_3138.heic"  title="A selfie with my choirmates on the bus on the way to Gensan">
				<img src="LithiumPobre2ndQtrProj_v1/images/img_3201.heic" title="On the way to get FREE JOLLIBEE for lunch <33">
				<ul>
					<li>I was absent for a day in school because I'm part of the PSHS-SRC Chorale. We were part of the opening ceremony
					during RSTW (Regional Science and Technology Week) and sang Lupang Hinirang, DOST Hymn, and Eye of the Tiger. Some of
					the senior chorale members performed their own songs and we loved it. In RSTW there were many exhibits like food stalls, planetarium,
					movie screening, and our batchmates' robotic exhibit. It was a fun experience, a breather from academics. And I had fun once again
					by exploring around SM with my fellow choirmates. We even ate at Starbucks and played a little bit at the arcade.  Sadly, we were
					only there for a day and went back to school in the afternoon.
